# Genguessr - API

Welcome to the Genguessr API.

This application uses the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework. This
framework is an opinionated wrapper around Express. It uses dependency injection
and a module pattern for domain segregation. If you've not used it before I'd
suggest reading the first parts of the [documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/).

## Structure

This project contains two modules: `game` and `images`. Each contains one
controller.

It also includes an `app` controller and service. These are left as an example
of how the service injection pattern works.

## Installation

**Use mono-repo setup instructions [here](../README.md#setup)**

## Running the app

```bash
# development
pnpm run start

# watch mode
pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
pnpm run start:prod
```

## Tests

The project includes unimplemented test files (`*.spec.ts`). These have been
autogenerated by the Nest scaffolding tool. They have been left in the project
to illustrate how tests can be setup in NestJS.

```bash
# unit tests
pnpm run test

# test coverage
pnpm run test:cov
```

## Nest CLI

Nest provides a CLI tool which is not required but can be helpful to scaffold
new services and modules. It can be installed using:

```sh
# Install Nest CLI globally
pnpm add -g @nestjs/cli
```

It has it's own documentation [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview).

When using it, be sure to run it from within the root of the Nest project as
opposed to the root of the monorepo. Otherwise Nest will try and create it's own
monorepo structure.
