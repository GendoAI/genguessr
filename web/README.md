# Genguessr - Web

Welcome to the Genguessr web application.

This application uses the [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/docs/) framework. It is
built upon React and adds features such as folder-based routing and server-side
rendering (SSR). SSR is not used in this project. If you've not used this
framework before I'd suggest reading the first parts of the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Structure

This Next.js application uses the app-router. It contains only two pages: the
root page and `./game`. A few refactored components have been added to the
`components` directory.

## Installation

**Use mono-repo setup instructions [here](../README.md#setup)**

## Running the app

```bash
# development
pnpm run dev

# build
pnpm run build
```
